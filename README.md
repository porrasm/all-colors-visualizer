# all-colors-visualizer
The app I used to make this video: [Every Color Your Monitor Can Show You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-Y3rbE7jec&amp;feature=youtu.be)

## About

The code is pretty messy. It was an older project which I kind of forgot about and I just quickly updated it. The code is not commented and there are probably bugs and budget solutions. I figured that maybe someone would want to do something with this idea so I decided to share it.


## What does it do?

Currently it cycles through every color and saves every frame as jpg into P:/Stuff/ColorImages. You will have to change this to work, and you will probably want to disable the recording feature all together. Visit [releases](https://github.com/porrasm/all-colors-visualizer/releases) for a version that does not save any frames and just loops through every color.
